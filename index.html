<h1>The Theory of Mathistence</h1>
  
 The theory is basically that mathematical facts like 2+2=4 have to be as they are. 
  Likewise the solution to the mathematical laws of physics has to be our universe including us thinking we exist.
  And this is basically why the universe exists and why there is something rather than nothing.
