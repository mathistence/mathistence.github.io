<p>It can be puzzling why there is something rather than nothing. Here I give some ideas as to how the universe, time, space and laws of physics got here.</p>
		
<h3>The Basic Hypothesis</h3>

<p>
Mathematical facts such as two plus two equalling four have to be. Similarly part of the solution to our laws of physics equals you reading this. This is sufficient for it to seem real to you and similarly to other evolved life. This is the basic reason for existence. </p>

<h3> Why is there something rather nothing?</h3>



<p>It's long been a bit of a puzzle as to why the universe exists rather than there just being nothing. If you say a god did it, it leaves you to explain how they got there and why that god. Likewise with laws of physics and they big bang it leaves you to explain why those. 
</p>

<h3>An argument as to why there is</h3>
<p>
To explain why there is something rather than nothing while getting around the how did that get there issue, the only way seems to be to start from something that has to exist without needing a creator. So you can look around for things that might fit.
</p><p>
About the only things you come there are as far as I can tell are what you could call mathematical facts, things like 2+2=4 or the Mandelbrot set looking like it does. These definitely have some sort of existence in that they can be discovered and looked at and say aliens in some other universe could have a look and find the same stuff. They exist by a kind of logical necessity. 
</p><p>
When you mention this stuff people get side tracked by Plato who talked about this and speculated things like 4 exited in a realm of perfect forms with the ideal 4 in it which is a bit silly. It's possible to accept 2+2=4 without dragging Plato into it).
</p><p>
Anyway we have this mathematical stuff that looks like it has to be in some sense and then there is the observation that the laws of physics are a bunch of maths and the fundamental particles seem a bit more like mathematical objects rather than something solid you could take a photo of. 
</p><p>
So maybe it's all maths and that's why it's all here. The solutions exist to all possible mathematical relationships in the sense that they could be discovered, this is sufficient for it to seem real to evolved life within them and that's it really. The relationships that the life is part of would seem physical reality to them and other solutions would seem like abstract maths and visa verso to life in other solutions. 
</p><p>
You can even offer a sort of thought experiment proof that could be discovered type existence would lead to it seeming real to those within before being discovered as follows:
</p><p>
Say you have some equations looking like laws of physics and run a simulation on a hyper powerful computer to see what they would produce. You press go and see a big bang, life evolve and say some evolved life go down the pub. Presumably the decision to go down the pub would be as a result of evolved consciousness hence seem real to the evolvee but it would have always been thus hence there before you did the computing. 
</p><p>

As to why to believe this - it fits the observation we exist and provides an explanation for why it's all here, and there isn't any other explanation we know of hence it's probably the one.
</p>

<h3>Similar ideas</h3>
<p>This is rather similar to Max Tegmark's mathematical universe hypothesis "Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure." Except I don't think he has the something rather than nothing bit and also I'm trying to tack on some be nice and happiness stuff.
</p>

<h3>Time, Space and the Quantum</h3>
<p>
Time and space would exist as something like four dimensional relativistic space-time, or a bit like how they exist in a movie where you have space and time when you play if but the movie is unchanging in it's totality. 

Quantum randomness would probably come down to the universe branching in the Many Worlds style so it wouldn't really be a four dimensional object but just look like that. 
</p>

<h3>Testable?</h3>
<p>
</p>

You can consider this as a hypothesis. Presumably it either the reason for existence or it isn't and it seems perhaps an interesting question which it is. I've had arguments that the theory is meaningless, like saying the universe came out of the back of a duck or something but that's not really true - you could use a telescope to see if there's signs of the duck and likewise with god did it theories you can have a look a the guy sitting on a cloud depicted on the Sistine chapel and compare that with real clouds next time you get a window seat and figure that one is perhaps unlikely. 
.</p>



<h3>Simplicity and first principles</h3>
<p>
This stuff can get confusing so it's easiest to stick to simple things you can prove such as that prime numbers exist in that you can find them, rather than getting side tracked into what Plato may have thought about it all. 
</p>


<h3>Philosophical implications?</h3>

<p>A nice point is it would mean we are eternal and have to be here. Time passing is just a matter or perspective. Also imagined things like heaven and gods exist as their own realities and in some ways exist as much as ours. They can just only effect this one though perception or calculation in this world. So we can perhaps choose an upbeat one to focus on and to manifest in our minds and hence this world.

I'm putting some philosophical stuff on another domain
